<p> "The good Christian should beware of mathematicians. The danger already exists that mathematicians have made a covenant with the devil to darken the spirit and confine man in the bonds of Hell." - Saint Augustine </p>
<p> "A mathematician is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat which isn't there." - Charles Darwin </p>
<p> "The <i>evident</i> character of this defective cognition of which mathematics is proud, and on which it plumes itself before philosophy, rests solely on the poverty of its purpose and the defectiveness of its stuff, and is therefore of a kind that philosophy must spurn" - G.W.F. Hegel </p>
<p> "What have we? I ask. Railways, factories, 
chemists, mathematicians. To be sure, our bodies 
are better off, we suffer less in the flesh, but the 
heart still bleeds! Do you not feel the perturbation 
of your soul, although its outward covering seems 
calm and happy? It is plunged in the abyss of universal scepticism; it is overcome by that deadly ennui 
that seizes upon our race even in the cradle. Meanwhile, politicians babble, poets have scarcely time to 
rhyme their fancies and scribble them hastily on 
ephemeral sheets of paper; and the suicidal bullet is 
heard in every garret and every palace where dwell 
misery, pride, or satiety!" - Gustave Flaubert </p>
<p>"In Mathematics we never know what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true." - Bertrand Russell </p>
