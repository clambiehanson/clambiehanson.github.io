    <b>Guessing models, cardinal arithmetic, and ultrafilters</b>
    (Logic Colloquium 2024, Set Theory Special Session, Gothenburg,
    June 2024.)</div>
    (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

    <div id="a69" class="texter">
      Guessing models were introduced by Viale and Weiss in the course
      of their investigations into the consistency strength of the
      Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA). It quickly became apparent that
      guessing models are powerful tools for obtaining instances of
      compactness, and over the last fifteen years they have seen
      numerous applications. For example, results of Weiss and of
      Viale indicate that the existence of guessing models implies
      the failure of relatively weak square principles, and results of
      Viale and of Krueger combine to show that the existence of
      guessing models implies the Singular Cardinals Hypothesis (SCH).

      In this talk, we present two recent applications of guessing
      models. In the first, we pursue further investigations into the
      impact of guessing models on cardinal arithmetic. We show, for
      instance, that the existence of guessing models tightly correlates the values of \(2^{\aleph_0}\)
      and \(2^{\aleph_1}\), and also that the existence of guessing
      models implies Shelah’s Strong Hypothesis (SSH), a PCF-theoretic
      strengthening of SCH. We then use ideas from these arguments to
      show that the generalized narrow system property, a close
      relative of the strong tree property, at a cardinal \(\kappa\)
      implies SSH above \(\kappa\).

      The second application concerns indecomposable ultrafilters. A
      non-principal ultrafilter
      \(U\) over a cardinal \(\kappa > \aleph_1\) is indecomposable
      if, for every \(\lambda < \kappa\) and every \(f:\kappa
      \rightarrow \lambda\), there is a set \(A \in U\) such that
      \(f[A]\) is countable. Sheard, answering a question of Silver,
      proved in the 1980s that, relative to the consistency of a
      measurable cardinal, it is consistent that there is an
      inaccessible cardinal \(\kappa\) such that \(\kappa\) carries an
      indecomposable ultrafilter but \(\kappa\) is not weakly compact.
      Recently, Goldberg showed that this cannot happen above a strongly
      compact cardinal: If \(\mu\) is strongly compact and \(\kappa
      \geq \mu\) carries an indecomposable ultrafilter, then
      \(\kappa\) is either measurable or a limit of countably many
      measurable cardinals. Using guessing models, we show that the
      same conclusion follows from PFA. This provides another instance
      in the long list of compactness principles that were first shown to
      hold above a strongly compact or supercompact cardinal and later shown also to follow from PFA.

    <b>Squares, ultrafilters, and forcing axioms</b>
    (CUNY Set Theory Seminar (online), March 2023.)</div>

    <div id="a66" class="texter">
      A uniform ultrafilter \(U\) over a cardinal \(\kappa > \omega_1\) is called \emph{indecomposable}
      if, whenever \(\lambda < \kappa\) and \(f:\kappa \rightarrow \lambda\), there is a set \(X \in U\) such that
      \(f[X]\) is countable. Indecomposability is a natural weakening of \(\kappa\)-completeness
      and has a number of implications for, e.g., the structure of ultraproducts. In the 1980s, Sheard answered
      a question of Silver by proving the consistency of the existence of an inaccessible but not weakly compact
      cardinal carrying an indecomposable ultrafilter. Recently, however, Goldberg proved that this situation
      cannot hold above a strongly compact cardinal: If \(\lambda\) is strongly compact and \(\kappa \geq \lambda\)
      carries an indecomposable ultrafilter, then \(\kappa\) is either measurable or a singular limit of countably
      many measurable cardinals. We prove that the same conclusion follows from the Proper Forcing Axiom,
      thus adding to the long list of statements first shown to hold above a strongly compact or supercompact
      cardinal and later shown also to follow from PFA. Time permitting, we will employ certain indexed square
      principles to prove that our results are sharp. This is joint work with Assaf Rinot and Jing Zhang.

  <div id="a61" class="texter">
    Motivated by the general study of continuous images of generalised Baire spaces,
    Philipp L&uuml;cke and Philipp Schlicht recently began an investigation into
    higher Kurepa trees from the viewpoint of generalised descriptive set theory.
    In particular, they were interested in the question of when a given

    \([T]\), the set of all cofinal branches through \(T\), is a continuous image
    or retract of the full generalised Baire space \({^\kappa}\kappa\). In this talk,
    we will discuss some recent further work in this direction. In particular, we will
    present a model in which CH holds and there are \(\omega_2\)-Kurepa trees

  <div id="a59" class="texter">
    Whitehead's problem, which asks whether every Whitehead abelian group
    is a free abelian group, was a prominent open question in group theory
    in the mid-20th century. In 1974, Shelah proved that the problem is
    independent of ZFC, which was a surprising development and provided one
    of the first instances of a major problem coming from outside logic and
    set theory to be proven independent of ZFC. In recent years, Clausen and
    Scholze have introduced the category of <i>condensed abelian groups</i>,
    which can be seen as an enrichment of the category of topological abelian
    groups with nicer algebraic properties. Through some deep structural analysis
    of this category, they showed that, when appropriately interpreted, Whitehead's
    problem is not independent in the category of condensed abelian groups:
    it is provable in ZFC that every abelian group that is Whitehead in the condensed
    category must be free. In this talk, we sketch a new, more concrete proof of Clausen
    and Scholze's result, in the process highlighting some connections between condensed
    mathematics and the theory of forcing. This is joint work with Jeffrey Bergfalk and

    Narrow systems and the singular cardinals hypothesis</b>

    <div id="a57" class="texter">Two-cardinal tree properties, and their effect on cardinal arithmetic, have been
a central topic of study in combinatorial set theory over the last fifteen years. Notably, a pair
of results due to Viale and Krueger, respectively, shows that the strongest of these principles,
\(\mathsf{ISP}(\kappa)\), implies that the singular cardinals hypothesis holds above \(\kappa\).
This raises the natural question of whether the same conclusion follows from the weaker
\(\mathsf{ITP}(\kappa)\) or the strong tree property at \(\kappa\). We address this question by introducing
the notion of a generalized narrow system and the generalized narrow system property.
This generalized narrow system property holds in all known models of the strong tree property
and is often implicitly used in the verification of the strong tree property. We will show that
the generalized narrow system property at a cardinal \(\kappa\) implies the singular cardinals
hypothesis above \(\kappa\). We also present a consistency result showing that the generalized
      narrow system property can hold globally.

    <div id="a50" class="texter">Shortly after the advent of forcing in the 1960s, Easton proved that,
modulo some trivial constraints concerning monotonicity and cofinality, the axioms
of set theory place no restrictions on the behavior of exponentiation at regular cardinals. In a
surprising turn of events, this turned out not to be the case for singular cardinals,
and the last half-century has seen a procession of deep results uncovering nontrivial constraints on
exponentiation at singular cardinals. One of the first of these results was Silver's theorem,
which in essence states that if \(\lambda\) is a singular cardinal of uncountable cofinality
and there are "many" singular cardinals \(\kappa < \lambda\) such that \(2^\kappa = \kappa^+\),
then it must also be the case that \(2^\lambda = \lambda^+\). In particular, if the Singular Cardinals
Hypothesis fails, then it must fail first at a singular cardinal of countable cofinality. We will discuss
this seminal theorem and a number of variations thereon, and we will end by sketching a proof of

  and a weakening of Jensen's principle \(\square_\kappa\). Our framework takes the
  form of a forcing axiom, \(\mathrm{SDFA}(\mathcal{P}_\kappa)\). We show that
  \(\mathrm{SDFA}(\mathcal{P}_\kappa)\) follows from
  the conjunction of \(\diamondsuit(\kappa)\) and our weakening of \(\square_\kappa\) and, if
  \(\kappa\) is the successor of an uncountable cardinal, that
  \(\mathrm{SDFA}(\mathcal{P}_\kappa)\) is in fact
  equivalent to this conjunction. We also show that, for an infinite cardinal \(\lambda\),
  \(\mathrm{SDFA}(\mathcal{P}_{\lambda^+})\) implies the existence of a
  \(\lambda^+\)-complete \(\lambda^{++}\)-Souslin tree.
  This implies that, if \(\lambda\) is an uncountable cardinal, \(2^\lambda = \lambda^+\), and

It is a folklore result that, for a cardinal \(\mu\), \(\square_\mu\) implies a strong failure of

square principle \(\square(\kappa)\) implies the failure of simultaneous stationary

  because most large cardinal notions are preserved under small forcing extensions,
  i.e. forcing extensions by posets with cardinality less than \(\kappa\), these
  reflection principles, when they hold at large cardinals, are also robust under
  small forcing. It has been a fruitful line of research to consider the extent
  to which these reflection principles can hold at smaller cardinals. However,
  these principles can in general fail to be preserved by small forcing when they
  hold at small cardinals. Focusing on stationary reflection and the tree property,
  we discuss situations in which reflection principles can fail to be robust under

  Robust reflection principles.</b> (Cornell University Logic Seminar, September 2015.)</div>
<div id="a16" class="texter">Large cardinals are useful in set theory in part
  because they imply certain reflection properties. For example, if \(\kappa\) is a
  weakly compact cardinal, then \(\kappa\) satisfies the tree property and every stationary
  subset of \(\kappa\) reflects. An interesting direction of research involves
  investigating the extent to which these reflection properties can hold at smaller
  cardinals. By results of Levy and Solovay, for most large cardinal notions
  (inaccessible, weakly compact, measurable, etc.), if \(\kappa\) is such a large cardinal
  in V and \(\mathbb{P}\) is a forcing poset of size less than \(\kappa\), then \(\kappa\) remains
  large after forcing with \(\mathbb{P}\). Therefore, reflection properties of a cardinal
  \(\kappa\) that are implied by \(\kappa\) being a particular large cardinal are themselves
  indestructible by small forcing when \(\kappa\) is such a large cardinal. However,
  these reflection properties may no longer be indestructible at \(\kappa\) if \(\kappa\)
  is a small cardinal. For example, it is consistent that \(\aleph_{\omega+1}\) has the
  tree property but there is a forcing \(\mathbb{P}\) of size \(\omega_1\) such that \(\aleph_{\omega+1}\)
  fails to have the tree property after forcing with \(\mathbb{P}\). We will begin by reviewing
  the relevant large cardinal and reflection notions and will then consider
  strengthenings of certain reflection properties that are always indestructible
  under small forcing, focusing in particular on stationary reflection and the
  tree property. We will look at the extent to which these reflection properties
